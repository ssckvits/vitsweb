        <h1>ABOUT VITS</h1>
        <p class="about">
            During the cluster-level establishment of computer resource centers in the government school system in 1995 and 1996, the St. Sylvester's College Alumni Assistance Center established a college computer unit without assistance from the Ministry of Education. The history of the college indicates that by the end of 1996, the Ministry of Education had donated 5 computers, and donors had contributed 2 additional computers to the College Computer Science Association, which was established alongside the computer unit. It is no exaggeration to say that the period from 2004 to 2005 marked the beginning of St. Sylvester's golden age, as 2005 was the year the college won the National Productivity Gold Award. The IT unit has provided computer support throughout this journey.        </p>
        <p class="about">
            St. Sylvester’s ICT Society has achieved several significant milestones over the years. Notably, our college team excelled by securing first place in the inter-school quiz competition held alongside the ICT Kandy 2007 Trade and Education Exhibition. In 2011, the College ICT Society demonstrated its prowess by clinching both the first and tenth positions at the national level during the provincial competition, which coincided with the prestigious National IT Excellence Competition. Moreover, the society's participation in the 2017 ICT Mastermind competition saw it rank among the top 4 teams. Beyond competitions, St. Sylvester’s College students have consistently triumphed in the Young Computer Champions competition, showcasing their dedication and skill. Additionally, a significant achievement was the successful upgrade and launch of the college's official website in 2021, enhancing our digital presence and accessibility.        </p>
